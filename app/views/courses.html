By focusing both on a comparison of language structures and sound systems as well as theories of second language acquisition and development, this course allows students to learn about differences between learning a first and a second language and the influences of these processes on instructional principles and strategies. This course includes an intensive language learning component for students in the course that will allow them to reflect on their own learning processes in relation to language learning theories and to compare English to another language.</p>

    <h3>Languages Courses - (ESL/EFL)</h3>

    <h4><em>Intermediate Level 700 Core Course (All Skills)</em></h4>

Course materials include newspaper articles and reviews, essays, extracts from novels and film scripts, listening extracts from radio and television (reviews, interviews, awards presentations), and short film sequences. Listening and speaking improve as they hear and practice how English is pronounced at normal speed. Analyzing dialogue makes their conversation more effective. Course materials encourage them to examine cultural aspects of language use in real life. In-class activities give them opportunities to discover and discuss classmates' experiences and opinions, and to compare their own culture and ways of communicating with those represented in film extracts. Writing assignments range from formal letters and essays to mini-scripts. Online grammar and in-class vocabulary work are reinforced through listening, speaking, and writing.</p>
